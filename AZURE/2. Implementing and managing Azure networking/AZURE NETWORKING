AZURE VIRTUAL NETWORK:
======================
1. What is Azure Virtual Network?
------------------------------
- Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. 
- VNet enables many types of Azure resources, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VM), to securely 
  communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. 
- VNet is similar to a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, but brings with 
  it additional benefits of Azure's infrastructure such as scale, availability, and isolation.
  
2. Why use an Azure Virtual network?
------------------------------------
- Azure virtual network enables Azure resources to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. 
- Key scenarios that you can accomplish with a virtual network include - communication of Azure resources with the internet, 
  communication between Azure resources, communication with on-premises resources, filtering network traffic, routing network 
  traffic, and integration with Azure services.
  
3. Communicate with the internet:
---------------------------------
- All resources in a VNet can communicate outbound to the internet, by default. 
- You can communicate inbound to a resource by assigning a public IP address or a public Load Balancer. 
- You can also use public IP or public Load Balancer to manage your outbound connections. 

4. Communicate between Azure resources:
----------------------------------------
Azure resources communicate securely with each other in one of the following ways:

Through a virtual network: 
...........................
- You can deploy VMs, and several other types of Azure resources to a virtual network, such as Azure App Service Environments, 
  the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets.

Through a virtual network service endpoint: 
............................................
- Extend your virtual network private address space and the identity of your virtual network to Azure service resources, 
  such as Azure Storage accounts and Azure SQL Database, over a direct connection. Service endpoints allow you to secure
  
Through VNet Peering:
......................
- You can connect virtual networks to each other, enabling resources in either virtual network to communicate with each other, 
  using virtual network peering. The virtual networks you connect can be in the same, or different, Azure regions. 

5. Communicate with on-premises resources:
-------------------------------------------
- You can connect your on-premises computers and networks to a virtual network using any combination of the following options:

Point-to-site virtual private network (VPN): 
............................................
- Established between a virtual network and a single computer in your network. 
- Each computer that wants to establish connectivity with a virtual network must configure its connection.  
- The communication between your computer and a virtual network is sent through an encrypted tunnel over the internet.

Site-to-site VPN: 
-----------------
- Established between your on-premises VPN device and an Azure VPN Gateway that is deployed in a virtual network. 
- This connection type enables any on-premises resource that you authorize to access a virtual network. 
- The communication between your on-premises VPN device and an Azure VPN gateway is sent through an encrypted tunnel over the internet.

Azure ExpressRoute: 
--------------------
- Established between your network and Azure, through an ExpressRoute partner. This connection is private. Traffic does not go over the internet. 


6. Filter network traffic:
---------------------------
- You can filter network traffic between subnets using either or both of the following options:

Network security groups: 
.........................
- Network security groups and application security groups can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules that 
  enable you to filter traffic to and from resources by source and destination IP address, port, and protocol. 
  
Network virtual appliances: FIREWALLS 
...........................
- A network virtual appliance is a VM that performs a network function, such as a firewall, WAN optimization, or other network function. 


7. Route network traffic:
---------------------------
- Azure routes traffic between subnets, connected virtual networks, on-premises networks, and the Internet, by default

Route tables: You can create custom route tables with routes that control where traffic is routed to for each subnet.
--------------

8. Virtual network integration for Azure services:
--------------------------------------------------
- Integrating Azure services to an Azure virtual network enables private access to the service from virtual machines or compute resources in the virtual network.

9.Azure VNet limits:
----------------------
- There are certain limits around the number of Azure resources you can deploy. Most Azure networking limits are at the maximum values. 
  However, you can increase certain networking limits as specified on the VNet limits page

10. Virtual networks and availability zones:
-----------------------------------------------
- Virtual networks and subnets span all availability zones in a region. 
- You don't need to divide them by availability zones to accommodate zonal resources. 
For example, if you configure a zonal VM, you don't have to take into consideration the virtual network when selecting the availability zone for the VM. 
The same is true for other zonal resources


11.Pricing:
-----------
- There is no charge for using Azure VNet; it is free of cost. 
- Standard charges are applicable for resources, such as Virtual Machines (VMs) and other products. 
- To learn more, see VNet pricing and the Azure pricing calculator.
