Virtual network peering:
========================
- Virtual network peering enables you to seamlessly connect two or more Virtual Networks in Azure. 
- The virtual networks appear as one for connectivity purposes.
- Azure supports the following types of peering:
. Virtual network peering: Connect virtual networks within the same Azure region.
. Global virtual network peering: Connecting virtual networks across Azure regions.

Network traffic between peered virtual networks is private. Traffic between the virtual networks is kept on the Microsoft backbone network. 
No public Internet, gateways, or encryption is required in the communication between the virtual networks.
