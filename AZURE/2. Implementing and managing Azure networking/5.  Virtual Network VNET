Virtual Network:
================
- Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. 
- VNet enables many types of Azure resources, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VM), to securely 
  communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.

1.Create a virtual network:
---------------------------
1. Select Create a resource in the upper left-hand corner of the portal.

2. In the search box, enter Virtual Network. Select Virtual Network in the search results.

3. In the Virtual Network page, select Create.

4. In Create virtual network, enter or select this information in the Basics tab:

5. Select the IP Addresses tab, or select the Next: IP Addresses button at the bottom of the page.

6.In IPv4 address space, select the existing address space and change it to 10.1.0.0/16.

7. Select + Add subnet, then enter MySubnet for Subnet name and 10.1.0.0/24 for Subnet address range.

8. Select Add.

9. Select the Security tab, or select the Next: Security button at the bottom of the page.

10. Select the Review + create tab or select the Review + create button.

11. Select Create.



2. Create a Virtual Network Using Azure CLI:
---------------------------------------------
# az network vnet create --name myVNet --resource-group CreateVNetQS-rg --subnet-name default




2.Azure Subnet:
=================

- As we know, the subnet is a part of a network that covers a range of IP Address. 
  In Azure, VNet can be divided into smaller subnets for organizations. 
  When a VNet is created in Azure, the subnet range and topology needs to be specified. 
  In Subnet, the IP Address range will be a subpart from a big block of IP Address used 
  in Virtual Network (VNet). The Virtual Machines and resources in a network will be assigned 
  the IP Address from these subnets.
  
  
Create Subnetwork using Azure Portal:
---------------------------------------
1. Go to the Azure portal to view your virtual networks. Search for and select Virtual networks.
2. Select the name of the virtual network you want to add a subnet to.
3. From Settings, select Subnets > Subnet.
4. In the Add subnet dialog box, enter values for the following settings:
5. To add the subnet to the virtual network that you selected, select OK.


Create Subnet using Azure Cli:
--------------------------------
# az network vnet create --name myVNet --resource-group CreateVNetQS-rg --subnet-name default
